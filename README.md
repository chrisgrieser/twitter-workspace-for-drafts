# Drafts Twitter Client (for Composing Tweets)
While not a full-fleged Twitter client when it comes to reading Tweets, Drafts text manipulation capabilities have many advantages when it comes to composing tweets, like automatic repalcement of common abbreviations (Action: "Shorten Text"), or creating a long Twitter thread in one go (Action: "Tweet Storm").

**Composing**
- Compose tweets with Twitter Syntax Highlighting (@mentions, #hashtags, ...).
- Send tweets from directly from Drafts.
- Automatically attach a hashtag when sending. Useful when tweeting repeatedly from a certain event
- "Tweet Storm": Send a longer text automatically as a chained Twitter thread 

**Overcome with the 280-character-limit**
- Visually indicate character limit.
- Insert common abbreviations (e.g. ¬¥with¬¥ ‚ûû  ¬¥w/¬¥) to stay under the character limit. Currently only for [English and German](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/twitter-workspace-for-drafts/blob/main/shorten_list.csv), but you can suggest  additions in other languages. Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/twitter-workspace-for-drafts/issues) or a pull make a pull request.
-  Save even more characters by replacing your text with various emojis (e.g. 'dog' ‚ûû üê∂). Define your own emojis-replacement.
-  Automatically suggest splits for the Tweet Storm.

**Read**
- Your sent tweets are archived at Drafts. This makes them easily searchable and allows you to run other Drafts acitons on them.
- Download faved tweets of any user.
- Download Twitter search results.
- View and print them in Markdown.

## Credits
- The syntax is derived from [nahumck's Tweet Syntax](https://actions.getdrafts.com/s/1iw) and adapted to work with the actions of this Workspace.
- Numerous actions (Tweet Storm, gettings Favs, Emojify, ...) are adapted versions from [agiletortoise](https://agiletortoise.com/)'s actions.
- This Workspace has otherwise been created by [Chris Grieser](https://chris-grieser.de/)
