# Drafts Twitter Client
While not a full-fleged Twitter client when it comes to interacting and reading tweets, Drafts text manipulation capabilities have many advantages. When it comes to the drafting of new tweets, Drafts can shine with features like automatic replacement of common abbreviations, or creating a long Twitter thread in one go (Tweet Storm).

**Composing**
- Compose tweets with Twitter Syntax Highlighting (@mentions, #hashtags, ...).
- Send tweets from directly from Drafts.
- Automatically attach a hashtag when sending. Useful when tweeting repeatedly from a certain event
- _Tweet Storm_: Send a longer text automatically as a chained Twitter thread.
- On iOS, easily quickly insert `#` and `@`.

**Overcome with the 280-character-limit**
- Visually indicate character limit.
- Insert common abbreviations (e.g. `with` ‚ûû  `w/`) to stay under the character limit. Currently only for [English and German](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/twitter-workspace-for-drafts/blob/main/shorten_list.csv), but you can suggest  additions in other languages. Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/twitter-workspace-for-drafts/issues) or a pull make a pull request.
-  Save even more characters by replacing your text with various emojis (e.g. `dog` ‚ûû `üê∂`). Define your own emojis-replacement.
-  Automatically suggest splits for the Tweet Storm.

**Read**
- Download faved tweets of any user.
- Download Twitter search results.
- View and print them in Markdown.

**Use with Drafts**
- Tweets sent from Drafts are naturally archived in Drafts. This makes them easily searchable and allows you to run other Drafts acitons on them.
- Call the Workspace via `Load Twitter Workspace` action to automatically imply the tags, syntax and visual needed for this workspace.

## Setup
- Install the [Workspace](https://actions.getdrafts.com/w/1mN).
- Install the [Action-Group](https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1mP).
- Install the [Syntax](https://actions.getdrafts.com/s/1mM).
- _Theme:_ I recommend [Northern Light](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1jC) and [Northern Dark](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1jD) by kimonostereo as they match Twitter's aesthetic. 

## Credits
- The syntax is derived from [nahumck's Tweet Syntax](https://actions.getdrafts.com/s/1iw) and adapted to work with the actions of this Workspace.
- Numerous actions (Tweet Storm, gettings Favs, Emojify, ...) are adapted versions from [agiletortoise](https://agiletortoise.com/)'s actions.
- This Workspace has otherwise been created by [Chris Grieser](https://chris-grieser.de/)
